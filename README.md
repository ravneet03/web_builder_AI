# Web Builder AI  
  
_Automate website building with AI-powered solutions._  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Web Builder AI is an AI-powered website builder that automates the creation of websites by generating UI components and structures based on user input. This tool simplifies the development process, making it easier for developers and non-developers to build professional-looking web applications.  

## ✨ Features  
- **AI-powered UI generation** – Uses AI models to suggest layouts and components.  
- **Customizable components** – Modify the generated structure according to your needs.  
- **Easy deployment** – Build and launch websites with minimal effort.  
- **Fast development** – Reduces manual coding and speeds up prototyping.  

## 🏗️ Project Structure  
```
webbuilder.ai/
│── be/            # Backend (Node.js, Express)
│── frontend/      # Frontend (React.js)
│── dist/          # Build directory
│── package.json   # Project dependencies
│── README.md      # Documentation

## 🔧 Setup & Installation  
To run this project locally, follow these steps:  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ravneet03/web_builder_AI.git
cd web_builder_AI
```

### **2. Open Two Terminal Windows**  
- **First Terminal (Backend setup):**  
  ```sh
  cd be
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
- **Second Terminal (Frontend setup):**  
  ```sh
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

### **3. Access the Application**  
Once both backend and frontend servers are running:  
- **Backend** runs on `http://localhost:5000`  
- **Frontend** runs on `http://localhost:3000`  

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. The **user inputs** their website requirements.  
2. The **AI model** analyzes the input and generates website components.  
3. The **backend processes** the request and provides structured output.  
4. The **frontend renders** the generated website dynamically.  
5. Users can **customize** or download the final website structure.  

## 📌 Dependencies  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **AI Integration:** (Mention AI-related dependencies if applicable)
